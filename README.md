# Advent of Code Solutions in C

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code** solutions in **C**! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ‰  
Iâ€™m solving these problems as part of my **DSA journey**, aiming to write efficient, clean, and minimalistic code. Each solution reflects my personal approach to solving the puzzles, focusing on what I believe to be the best method.

## ðŸ§© My Approach

Since Iâ€™m starting my **DSA** journey, my solutions are tailored based on my evolving understanding of algorithms and data structures. I focus on solving problems efficiently, keeping the code concise and optimized.

Each dayâ€™s solution represents what I personally think is the **best approach** based on my learning so far. I aim to apply the concepts Iâ€™m learning in DSA, focusing on clarity, performance, and clean code. ðŸš€
